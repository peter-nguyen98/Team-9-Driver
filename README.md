## Team 9 Connect-Four Driver

This is the driver for the software engineering programming assignment.  
TODO: Update description later. 

### Driver Requirements
TODO: Define "driver" using requirements, or link to requirements doc

### Building the Program

Running `make` will build the program.
A `source-list` file will be created, and results are put into the build directory. 

### Running the Program

Running `make connect-4` will run the program.  
TODO: Update later

### Examples

Our job with this assignment is to just build the driver. The player programs can be found under examples (see file hierarchy below). The racket examples are easiest to demonstrate 1) how to run a compiled player program, 2) how to run an interpreted player program, and 3) how to specify different programs against one another.

The examples directory has its own `README` for more details.
